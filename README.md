# queenstown-open-data-spike
Investigations into usage of Queenstown Open Data using Ember.js

## The Plans
This project represents a technology and usefulness investigation into the current open GIS data made available by Queenstown Lakes District Council.

Immediate next steps are:
* Be able to turn some layers on and off
* See if I can find layers with any useful data
